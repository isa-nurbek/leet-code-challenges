# Greedy Algorithms Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Greedy Algorithms Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering greedy algorithmsâ€”a powerful problem-solving technique where decisions are made step-by-step to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Develop a strong understanding of greedy problem-solving strategies
- Learn when and why greedy algorithms work (and when they donâ€™t)
- Solve classic greedy algorithm coding problems
- Analyze the correctness and efficiency of greedy approaches
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving greedy techniques
