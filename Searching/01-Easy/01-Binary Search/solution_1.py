# Problem Description:

"""
                                             Binary Search

Write a function that takes in a `sorted array` of integers as well as a `target integer`. The function should use the `Binary
Search` algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its `index` if it is, otherwise `-1`.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
target = 33
```

## Sample Output:
```
3
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```

"""
## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity:

Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, the algorithm compares the middle element
of the current interval with the target value and eliminates half of the remaining elements from consideration.

- **Best Case**: O(1) - when the target is the middle element of the array.
- **Worst Case**: O(log n) - when the target is at one of the ends or not present in the array.
- **Average Case**: O(log n)

Each recursive call processes half of the remaining elements, leading to a logarithmic number of operations with respect to the
input size.

### Space Complexity:

This is a recursive implementation, so we need to consider the call stack:
- In each recursive call, we only pass constant space (the array reference and a few indices).
- The maximum depth of the recursion is the number of times we can divide the array in half, which is logâ‚‚n.

Therefore:
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for the recursive call stack.

### Summary:
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion)

### Comparison with Iterative Binary Search:
An iterative implementation would have O(1) space complexity since it doesn't use the call stack. This recursive version uses
more space (O(log n)) due to the recursive calls, but both have the same O(log n) time complexity.
