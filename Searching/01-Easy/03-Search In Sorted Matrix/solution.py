# Problem Description:

"""
                                             Search In Sorted Matrix

You're given a `two-dimensional` array (a `matrix`) of distinct integers and a `target` integer. Each row in the matrix is sorted,
and each column is also sorted; the matrix doesn't necessarily have the same height and width.

Write a function that returns an array of the row and column indices of the target integer if it's contained in the matrix,
otherwise `[-1, -1]`.


## Sample Input:
```
matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 1000],
  [2, 5, 19, 31, 32, 1001],
  [3, 8, 24, 33, 35, 1002],
  [40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 1003],
  [99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004],
]

target = 44
```

## Sample Output:
```
[3, 3]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n + m) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the matrix's rows and `m` is the length of the matrix's columns.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity Analysis:

The algorithm starts at the top-right corner of the matrix (or bottom-left could also work) and moves either **left** (to
decrease the value) or **down** (to increase the value) based on the comparison with the `target`.

- **Worst Case**: The algorithm traverses at most one full row and one full column.  
  - For an `m x n` matrix, the maximum steps taken are `m + n - 1` (since you can go from the top-right to the bottom-left corner).  
  - Thus, the time complexity is **O(m + n)**.

### Space Complexity Analysis:

- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (only `row` and `col` variables are modified).  
- Thus, the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(m + n)**  
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**  

This is optimal for this problem since in the worst case, you must check at least one full row or column to confirm
the absence of the target.

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
The function `search_in_sorted_matrix` efficiently searches for a target number in a special kind of matrix ‚Äî one where **each
row is sorted from left to right** and **each column is sorted from top to bottom**.

---

## üîç Goal

Given such a matrix and a target value, return the **[row, column]** of the target if found, else return `[-1, -1]`.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Matrix Property

In the matrix:

```python
[
    [ 1,   4,   7,  12,  15, 1000],
    [ 2,   5,  19,  31,  32, 1001],
    [ 3,   8,  24,  33,  35, 1002],
    [40,  41,  42,  44,  45, 1003],
    [99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004],
]
```

* Every **row** is sorted left to right.
* Every **column** is sorted top to bottom.

So, we can eliminate entire rows or columns intelligently.

---

## üöÄ Approach: Start from Top-Right Corner

### Why top-right?

At any element at `(row, col)`:

* If the current value is **greater than** the target ‚Üí move **left** (values decrease).
* If the current value is **less than** the target ‚Üí move **down** (values increase).
* If it's equal ‚Üí return its position.

## üî¢ Code Walkthrough

```
def search_in_sorted_matrix(matrix, target):
    row = 0                                 # Start from the first row
    col = len(matrix[0]) - 1                # Start from the last column (top-right corner)

    while row < len(matrix) and col >= 0:   # Stay within matrix bounds
        if matrix[row][col] > target:       # Too big? Move left
            col -= 1
        elif matrix[row][col] < target:     # Too small? Move down
            row += 1
        else:                               # Found it
            return [row, col]

    return [-1, -1]                          # Not found
```

---

## üß™ Test Case 1

```
target = 44
```

Start at top-right: `matrix[0][5] = 1000`

| Step | Value | Action           | New Position |
| ---- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1    | 1000  | > 44 ‚Üí left      | (0, 4)       |
| 2    | 15    | < 44 ‚Üí down      | (1, 4)       |
| 3    | 32    | < 44 ‚Üí down      | (2, 4)       |
| 4    | 35    | < 44 ‚Üí down      | (3, 4)       |
| 5    | 45    | > 44 ‚Üí left      | (3, 3)       |
| 6    | 44    | == 44 ‚Üí ‚úÖ found | (3, 3)       |

**Output:** `[3, 3]`

---

## üß™ Test Case 2

```
target = 12
```

Start at `matrix[0][5] = 1000`

| Step | Value | Action            | New Position |
| ---- | ----- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 1    | 1000  | > 12 ‚Üí left       | (0, 4)       |
| 2    | 15    | > 12 ‚Üí left       | (0, 3)       |
| 3    | 12    | == 12 ‚Üí ‚úÖ found  | (0, 3)       |

**Output:** `[0, 3]`

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: **O(m + n)**

* At most we go down `m` times and left `n` times.
* Efficient for large matrices.

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

* No extra space used.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Start at top-right corner.
* Use matrix properties to eliminate rows/columns.
* Very efficient and elegant solution for sorted 2D matrices.

Here's an **ASCII visualization** of how the search progresses through the matrix in both test cases.

---

## üß™ Test Case 1: `target = 44`

### Matrix:

```
[
 [  1,   4,   7,  12,  15, 1000],
 [  2,   5,  19,  31,  32, 1001],
 [  3,   8,  24,  33,  35, 1002],
 [ 40,  41,  42,  44,  45, 1003],
 [ 99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004]
]
```

### Traversal path to find `44`:

We mark each visited cell with `*`, and the found target with `‚úî`.

```
[
 [  1,   4,   7,  12,  15, *1000],
 [  2,   5,  19,  31,  *32, *1001],
 [  3,   8,  24,  33,  *35, *1002],
 [ 40,  41,  42, ‚úî44,  *45, *1003],
 [ 99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004]
]
```

---

## üß™ Test Case 2: `target = 12`

### Traversal path to find `12`:

```
[
 [  1,   4,   7, ‚úî12,  *15, *1000],
 [  2,   5,  19,  31,  32, 1001],
 [  3,   8,  24,  33,  35, 1002],
 [ 40,  41,  42,  44,  45, 1003],
 [ 99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004]
]
```

---

## üîÅ Legend

* `*` ‚Üí Visited cell
* `‚úî` ‚Üí Target found

This makes it visually clear how the algorithm ‚Äúslides‚Äù left/down toward the target using the matrix‚Äôs sorted nature.
