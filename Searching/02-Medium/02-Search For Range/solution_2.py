# Problem Description:

"""
                                             Search For Range

Write a function that takes in a `sorted array` of integers as well as a `target integer`. The function should use a variation of
the `Binary Search` algorithm to find a range of indices in between which the target number is contained in the array and should
return this range in the form of an array.

The first number in the output array should represent the first index at which the target number is located, while the second number
should represent the last index at which the target number is located. The function should return `[-1, -1]` if the integer isn't
contained in the array.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
target = 45
```

## Sample Output:
```
[4, 9]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given `search_for_range` function and its helper `altered_binary_search`.

### Time Complexity:

1. **Binary Search Variant**: The `altered_binary_search` function is a modified binary search. In the worst case, it will run
in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because, like standard binary search, it halves the
search space in each iteration.

2. **Two Binary Searches**: The `search_for_range` function calls `altered_binary_search` twiceâ€”once to find the left boundary
(`go_left=True`) and once to find the right boundary (`go_left=False`). Each of these calls is O(log n).

3. **Total Time Complexity**: Since we perform two O(log n) operations, the total time complexity remains **O(log n)**.
The constants (2 in this case) are dropped in Big-O notation.

### Space Complexity:

1. **Recursive vs. Iterative**: The `altered_binary_search` function is implemented iteratively (using a `while` loop), so it does
not use additional space on the call stack. This is in contrast to a recursive binary search, which would use O(log n) space due
to the call stack.

2. **Variables**: The function uses a constant amount of extra space (variables like `left`, `right`, `middle`, etc.), and the
`final_range` array is passed by reference and has a fixed size of 2.

3. **Total Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** (constant space), as no additional space is used that scales with
the input size.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

This is an efficient solution for finding the range of a target value in a sorted array. The two-pass binary search approach
ensures we correctly identify the boundaries of the target range.
