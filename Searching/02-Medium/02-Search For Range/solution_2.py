# Problem Description:

"""
                                             Search For Range

Write a function that takes in a `sorted array` of integers as well as a `target integer`. The function should use a variation of
the `Binary Search` algorithm to find a range of indices in between which the target number is contained in the array and should
return this range in the form of an array.

The first number in the output array should represent the first index at which the target number is located, while the second number
should represent the last index at which the target number is located. The function should return `[-1, -1]` if the integer isn't
contained in the array.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
target = 45
```

## Sample Output:
```
[4, 9]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given `search_for_range` function and its helper `altered_binary_search`.

### Time Complexity:

1. **Binary Search Variant**: The `altered_binary_search` function is a modified binary search. In the worst case, it will run
in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because, like standard binary search, it halves the
search space in each iteration.

2. **Two Binary Searches**: The `search_for_range` function calls `altered_binary_search` twice‚Äîonce to find the left boundary
(`go_left=True`) and once to find the right boundary (`go_left=False`). Each of these calls is O(log n).

3. **Total Time Complexity**: Since we perform two O(log n) operations, the total time complexity remains **O(log n)**.
The constants (2 in this case) are dropped in Big-O notation.

### Space Complexity:

1. **Recursive vs. Iterative**: The `altered_binary_search` function is implemented iteratively (using a `while` loop), so it does
not use additional space on the call stack. This is in contrast to a recursive binary search, which would use O(log n) space due
to the call stack.

2. **Variables**: The function uses a constant amount of extra space (variables like `left`, `right`, `middle`, etc.), and the
`final_range` array is passed by reference and has a fixed size of 2.

3. **Total Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** (constant space), as no additional space is used that scales with
the input size.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

This is an efficient solution for finding the range of a target value in a sorted array. The two-pass binary search approach
ensures we correctly identify the boundaries of the target range.

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
Let‚Äôs break down the code step by step and explain **how it works**, **why it works**, and **what it's doing under the hood**.

---

## üéØ **Goal of the Code**

The function `search_for_range(array, target)` searches for the **first and last occurrence (range)** of a given `target` in a
sorted array.

For example, if the array is:

```
[0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
```

and the target is `45`, the output will be `[4, 9]` ‚Äî because the first occurrence is at index 4 and the last at index 9.

---

## üîç High-Level Overview

The algorithm uses **modified binary search** to efficiently find the:

* **First occurrence** of the target (leftmost),
* **Last occurrence** of the target (rightmost).

This is done in **O(log n)** time instead of O(n) that a linear scan would take.

---

## üß† Main Function: `search_for_range`

```
def search_for_range(array, target):
    final_range = [-1, -1]  # Default value if target is not found

    altered_binary_search(array, target, 0, len(array) - 1, final_range, True)   # Search for first index
    altered_binary_search(array, target, 0, len(array) - 1, final_range, False)  # Search for last index

    return final_range
```

### What it does:

* Initializes `final_range` to `[-1, -1]` which will be returned if the target is not found.
* Calls `altered_binary_search` **twice**:

  * Once to find the **left boundary** (first occurrence),
  * Once to find the **right boundary** (last occurrence).
* Returns the result.

---

## üîç Helper Function: `altered_binary_search`

```
def altered_binary_search(array, target, left, right, final_range, go_left):
```

### Parameters:

* `array`: the sorted list.
* `target`: the number we‚Äôre searching for.
* `left`, `right`: current binary search boundaries.
* `final_range`: list storing the result (`[start, end]`).
* `go_left`: boolean flag to indicate if we‚Äôre searching for the **leftmost** or **rightmost** occurrence.

---

## üîÅ Inside the While Loop

```
while left <= right:
    middle = (left + right) // 2
```

Classic binary search loop. `middle` is the mid-index.

---

### üîÄ Case 1: `array[middle] < target`

```
left = middle + 1
```

The target must be in the right half.

---

### üîÄ Case 2: `array[middle] > target`

```
right = middle - 1
```

The target must be in the left half.

---

### ‚úÖ Case 3: `array[middle] == target`

This means we've found *an* occurrence of the target, but we may not yet be at the leftmost or rightmost occurrence.

Now we use `go_left` to decide whether to move left or right:

#### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è If `go_left == True`: search for **left boundary**

```
if middle == 0 or array[middle - 1] != target:
    final_range[0] = middle
    return
else:
    right = middle - 1  # keep moving left
```

* If `middle` is at the beginning, or the previous element is not equal to the target ‚Üí this is the first occurrence.
* Otherwise, keep going left.

---

#### ‚û°Ô∏è If `go_left == False`: search for **right boundary**

```
if middle == len(array) - 1 or array[middle + 1] != target:
    final_range[1] = middle
    return
else:
    left = middle + 1  # keep moving right
```

* If `middle` is at the end, or the next element is not equal to the target ‚Üí this is the last occurrence.
* Otherwise, keep going right.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Walkthrough

### Input:

```
search_for_range([0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73], 45)
```

### Steps:

1. First binary search (go_left = True) ‚Üí finds **first 45** at index 4.
2. Second binary search (go_left = False) ‚Üí finds **last 45** at index 9.
3. Output ‚Üí `[4, 9]`

---

## üß™ Edge Cases Handled

* Target not in array ‚Üí `final_range` remains `[-1, -1]`.
* Target occurs only once ‚Üí both left and right are the same index.
* All elements are the target ‚Üí returns `[0, len(array) - 1]`.

---

## üß† Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` ‚Äî Two binary searches.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` ‚Äî Only a few variables used.

## ‚úÖ Test Outputs Recap

```
print(search_for_range([0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73], 45))
# ‚ûú [4, 9]

print(search_for_range([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 5))
# ‚ûú [0, 0]

print(search_for_range([0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73], -1))
# ‚ûú [-1, -1]
```

Let's walk through an **ASCII visualization** of how this code searches for the **first and last occurrence** of the target
using **binary search**.

We'll use this example:

```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
target = 45
```

Indexes:

```
Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12
Array:  [0,  1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
```

## üîç Step-by-Step ASCII: Finding First Occurrence (`go_left = True`)

```
Initial left = 0, right = 12

# Step 1:
middle = (0 + 12) // 2 = 6
array[6] = 45 (== target)

   left                   mid                  right

                          => Not leftmost, move right to mid - 1 = 5

                          => Not rightmost, move left to mid + 1 = 7

# Step 2:
middle = (7 + 12) // 2 = 9
array[9] = 45 (== target)

                              mid
                               ‚Üì

                               => Rightmost found! final_range[1] = 9
