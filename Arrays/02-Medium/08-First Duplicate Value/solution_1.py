                                         # First Duplicate Value

Given an array of integers between `1` and `n`, inclusive, where `n` is the length of the array, write a function that
returns the first integer that appears more than once (when the array is read from left to right).

In other words, out of all the integers that might occur more than once in the input array, your function should return
the one whose first duplicate value has the minimum index.

If no integer appears more than once, your function should return `-1`.

Note that you're allowed to mutate the input array.


## Sample Input 1:
```
array = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]
```

## Sample Output 2:
```
2 // 2 is the first integer that appears more than once.
// 3 also appears more than once, but the second 3 appears after the second 2.
```

## Sample Input 3:
```
array = [2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4]
```

## Sample Output 3:
```
3 // 3 is the first integer that appears more than once.
// 2 also appears more than once, but the second 2 appears after the second 3.
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity Analysis

The given function `first_duplicate_value` uses a nested loop to find the first duplicate value in the array.
Let's break down the time complexity:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(array) - 1`, which means it iterates `n` times,
where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = len(array) - 1`. 
The number of iterations of the inner loop decreases as `i` increases:

   - When `i = 0`, the inner loop runs `n - 1` times.
   - When `i = 1`, the inner loop runs `n - 2` times.
   - ...
   - When `i = n - 1`, the inner loop runs `0` times.

   The total number of iterations of the inner loop is approximately:
   
        (n - 1) + (n - 2) + â‹¯ + 1 + 0 = n(n - 1) / 2
   
3. **Overall Time Complexity**: The total number of iterations is proportional to `n(n - 1) / 2`, which simplifies to - O(n^2).

   Therefore, the **time complexity** of the function is - O(n^2) .

---

### Space Complexity Analysis

The function uses a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size:

1. **Variables**: The function uses a few variables like `minimum_second_index`, `value`, and `value_to_compare`, 
but these do not depend on the size of the input array. They use a constant amount of space.

2. **No Additional Data Structures**: The function does not use any additional data structures (e.g., hash maps,
sets, or arrays) that grow with the input size.

   Therefore, the **space complexity** of the function is - O(1).

---

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) 
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) 

---

### Optimization Suggestion

The current implementation has a quadratic time complexity, which is inefficient for large arrays. We can optimize
this to O(n) time complexity by using a **hash set** to track seen values. 

We will implement optimized solution in (solution_2.py / solution_3.py)
