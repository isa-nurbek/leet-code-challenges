# Majority Element

Write a function that takes in a `non-empty`, `unordered array` of positive integers and returns the array's majority element without sorting the array and without using more than constant space.

An array's majority element is an element of the array that appears in over half of its indices. **Note that** the most common element of an array (the element that appears the most times in the array) isn't necessarily the array's majority element; for example, the arrays `[3, 2, 2, 1]` and `[3, 4, 2, 2, 1]` both have `2` as their most common element, yet neither of these arrays have a majority element, because neither `2` nor any other element appears in over half of the respective arrays' indices.

You can assume that the input array will always have a majority element.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2]
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
2

// 2 occurs in 4/7 array indices, making it the majority element
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 1</b></summary>

If the `array` were sorted, the middle element would have to be the majority element. However, this does not produce an optimal algorithm. Can you find a solution that does not require sorting?

<summary><b>Hint 2</b></summary>

Try to first guess that the first element in the `array` is the majority element. From here, iterate through the array, incrementing a counter for each copy of that candidate element that is found, and decrementing the counter for each other element that is found. If the counter ends greater than 1, then that element must be the majority element. Can you generalize this idea to work for cases where the majority element isn't the first element?

<summary><b>Hint 3</b></summary>

Instead of iterating all the way to the end of the `array`, try stopping once the counter hits `0`. At this point, the guessed majority element must not be the majority element in the subarray of the `array` that you have already looked at. Moreover, the actual majority element must still be the majority element in the remaining subarray of the `array`, since at most half of the values in the first subarray were the majority element (otherwise it would have had a negative count). With this intuition, you can just repeat this process, only using the remaining subarray.

<summary><b>Hint 4</b></summary>

This problem can also be solved using bit manipulation. Consider each of the bits used to store an integer. For each of these bits, if over half of the elements in the `array` have the bit set, then that bit must be set in the majority element as well. Doing this for each bit can determine which bits are set in the majority element, and thus what the majority element is.

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`O(n)` time | `O(1)` space - where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
