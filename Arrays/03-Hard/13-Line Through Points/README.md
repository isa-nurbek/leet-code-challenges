# Line Through Points

You're given an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (the xy-plane). Write a function that returns the maximum number of points that a single line (or potentially multiple lines) on the graph passes through.

The input array will contain points represented by an array of two integers [x, y]. The input array will never contain duplicate points and will always contain at least one point.
