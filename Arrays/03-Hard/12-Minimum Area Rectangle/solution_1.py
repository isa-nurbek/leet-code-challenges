# Problem Description:

"""

                                            Minimum Area Rectangle

You're given an array of points plotted on a `2D graph (the x,y-plane)`. Write a function that returns the minimum area of any
rectangle that can be formed using any `4` of these points such that the rectangle's sides are parallel to the `x` and `y` axes
(i.e., only rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides should be considered no rectangles with diagonal sides). If no rectangle
can be formed, your function should return `0`.

The input array will contain points represented by arrays of two integers `[x, y]`. The input array will never contain `duplicate
points`.


## Sample Input
```
points =
[
  [1, 5],
  [5, 1],
  [4, 2],
  [2, 4],
  [2, 2],
  [1, 2],
  [4, 5],
  [2, 5],
  [-1, -2],
]
```

## Sample Output
```
3

// The rectangle with corners [1, 5], [2, 5], [1, 2], and [2, 2] has the minimum area: 3
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n¬≤) time | O(n) space - where `n` is the number of points.
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

1. **Initialization (`initialize_columns` function):**
   - Iterates through all `n` points once: O(n)
   - Each insertion into the `columns` dictionary is O(1) on average.
   - Total: O(n)

2. **Sorting the x-coordinates (`sorted_columns`):**
   - Let `k` be the number of unique x-coordinates. Sorting them takes O(k log k).

3. **Main loop:**
   - Outer loop runs for each unique x-coordinate: O(k) iterations.
   - For each x, we sort its y-values: If there are `m_i` points in column x, this takes O(m_i log m_i). 
     - In the worst case, all points could be in the same column, making this O(n log n) for that column.
   - The nested double loop over y-values in the same column:
     - For a column with `m_i` y-values, the double loop runs O(m_i¬≤) times (since for each element,
     we compare with all previous elements).
     - In the worst case, this could be O(n¬≤) if all points are in the same column.
   - The operations inside the innermost loop (dictionary lookup and insertion) are O(1) on average.

**Worst-case time complexity:**
- The dominant terms are the O(n¬≤) from the nested y-loops (if all points are in the same column) and the O(n log n) from
sorting the y-values.
- Thus, the worst-case time complexity is O(n¬≤).

**Best-case time complexity:**
- If the points are spread out such that each column has at most 1 point, the nested loops do almost no work, and the complexity
is dominated by sorting the x-coordinates and y-values: O(n log n).


### Space Complexity:

1. **`columns` dictionary:**
   - Stores all `n` points: O(n) space.
2. **`edges_parallel_to_y_axis` dictionary:**
   - In the worst case, this stores all possible (y1, y2) pairs from a single column. If one column has all `n` points,
   the number of unique (y1, y2) pairs is O(n¬≤).
   - Thus, the worst-case space complexity is O(n¬≤).

**Worst-case space complexity:** O(n¬≤).

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) in the worst case, O(n log n) in the best case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n¬≤) in the worst case (due to the `edges_parallel_to_y_axis` dictionary), O(n) otherwise.

### Notes:
- The worst case occurs when many points share the same x-coordinate, leading to many (y1, y2) pairs being stored.
- In practice, if the points are well-distributed, the complexity will be closer to O(n log n) time and O(n) space.

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
This Python code finds the **minimum area of an axis-aligned rectangle** that can be formed from a given list of points on a 2D
plane. The rectangle's sides must be parallel to the x-axis and y-axis.

Let's walk through the code step by step.

---

## üß† **High-Level Idea**

A rectangle can be formed by **two vertical lines (same pair of y-values)** at **two different x-values**. So the code:

1. **Groups points by x-coordinate** (columns).
2. For each x-coordinate, it:

   * Looks at all **pairs of y-values**.
   * Forms a potential **vertical edge**.
3. If the **same y-pair** has been seen before at another x:

   * A rectangle is formed between those x-values and y-values.
   * Compute the area.
4. Keep track of the **minimum area found**.

---

## üîç Detailed Breakdown

### ‚úÖ `initialize_columns(points)`

Groups all the points by their `x` values:

```
{
    x1: [y1, y2, ...],
    x2: [y3, y4, ...],
    ...
}
```

#### Example:

Input:

```
[[1, 5], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 4], [2, 5]]
```

Output:

```
{
    1: [5, 2],
    2: [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This prepares us to iterate over all x-values and the y-values associated with each.

---

### ‚úÖ `minimum_area_rectangle(points)`

1. **Initialize:**

   * `columns`: from the helper.
   * `min_area_found`: starts as infinity.
   * `edges_parallel_to_y_axis`: a dictionary to store previously seen (y1, y2) edge and the x-value where it occurred.

2. **Sort x-values**: We process columns in increasing x order to ensure width is positive.

3. **Iterate through each column (x):**

   * Get `y_values_in_current_column`, sort them to process (y1, y2) pairs consistently.
   * For each **pair of y-values (y1, y2)**:

     * Create a key: `"y1:y2"` (e.g., "2:5")
     * If that y-pair has been seen before:

       * Compute area between current `x` and stored previous x:
         `area = (x - x_prev) * (y2 - y1)`
       * Update minimum area if it's smaller.
     * Store/update the current x for this y-pair.

---

### üîÅ Example: Walkthrough

Input:

```
points = [[1, 5], [5, 1], [4, 2], [2, 4], [2, 2], [1, 2], [4, 5], [2, 5], [-1, -2]]
```

Let‚Äôs focus on key pairs:

* At `x = 1`: y-values are `[2, 5]`, pair `"2:5"` is seen at x = 1.
* At `x = 2`: y-values are `[2, 4, 5]`. Pairs:

  * `"2:4"`: new
  * `"2:5"`: seen at x=1 ‚Üí rectangle formed with width = 1, height = 3 ‚Üí area = 3.

So far, `min_area_found = 3`. Other pairs are also checked to see if a smaller rectangle exists.

---

### üîö Final Step

If we‚Äôve seen any rectangle (`min_area_found` updated), return it. Otherwise, return `0`.

---

## ‚úÖ Output

### Test Case 1:

```
points = [[1, 5], [5, 1], [4, 2], [2, 4], [2, 2], [1, 2], [4, 5], [2, 5], [-1, -2]]
# Output: 3
```

Minimal rectangle formed between (1,2)-(1,5) and (2,2)-(2,5)

### Test Case 2:

```
points_2 = [[-4, 4], [4, 4], [4, -2], [-4, -2], [0, -2], [4, 2], [0, 2]]
# Output: 16
```

Rectangle from (-4, -2)-(4, -2)-(4, 4)-(-4, 4), area = 8 \* 2 = 16.

---

Let's visualize how the algorithm identifies a **minimum area rectangle** using ASCII art.

We‚Äôll use **Test Case 1**:

```
points = [[1, 5], [5, 1], [4, 2], [2, 4], [2, 2], [1, 2], [4, 5], [2, 5], [-1, -2]]
# Output: 3
```

We'll focus only on the key rectangle:

* Corners: `(1,2), (1,5), (2,2), (2,5)`

---

### üó∫Ô∏è Coordinate Plane (y: 6 to -1)

We'll mark:

* Points with `*`
* Rectangle edges with `|`, `-`, `+`
* X/Y axis reference

```
    y ‚Üë
      6 |

### üß± Highlighting the Rectangle (1,2) ‚Äî (2,5)

We draw lines connecting them:

```
    y ‚Üë
      6 |                    
      5 |    *       +---+   *
