# Trie Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Trie Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering **Tries**â€”an efficient tree-based data structure used for storing and retrieving strings, especially useful in search engines, autocomplete, and word games.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure
- Implement Trie operations from scratch
- Solve classic Trie-based coding problems
- Explore advanced applications of Tries in real-world scenarios
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving string manipulation

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of Trie-related topics, including:

- Trie node structures and linking
- Inserting words into a Trie
- Searching for complete words and prefixes
- Deleting words from a Trie
- Word autocomplete and predictive text
- Word search and dictionary matching
- Suffix Tries and compressed Tries (Radix Trees)
- Advanced applications (e.g., longest common prefix, word squares)
