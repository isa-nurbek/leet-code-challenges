# Binary Tree Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Binary Tree Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering binary treesâ€”one of the most fundamental and versatile data structures used in algorithms, problem-solving, and real-world applications.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Deepen understanding of binary tree concepts and traversal techniques
- Build custom binary tree implementations from scratch
- Solve classic binary tree coding problems
- Learn efficient strategies for searching, inserting, and balancing trees
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving binary trees

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of binary tree-related topics, including:

- Binary tree structures and properties
- Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals (recursive and iterative)
- Level order traversal (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS)
- Building trees from traversals
- Binary search trees (BSTs) and their operations
- Lowest common ancestor (LCA) problems
- Balanced trees and height balancing (e.g., AVL Trees basics)
- Serialization and deserialization of binary trees
- Advanced topics (e.g., diameter of a tree, subtree checking, tree views)
