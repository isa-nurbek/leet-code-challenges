# Binary Search Tree Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Binary Search Tree Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering binary search trees (BSTs)â€”a fundamental data structure used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Build a strong understanding of binary search tree properties
- Implement BSTs from scratch with key operations
- Solve classic binary search tree coding problems
- Learn traversal techniques and how BSTs support efficient algorithms
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving BSTs

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of BST-related topics, including:

- BST construction and node insertion
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals
- Searching for nodes (recursive and iterative approaches)
- Deleting nodes from a BST
- Finding the minimum and maximum values
- Checking if a tree is a valid BST
- Finding lowest common ancestors (LCA)
- Converting sorted arrays or linked lists into balanced BSTs
- Balancing techniques (intro to AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees)
