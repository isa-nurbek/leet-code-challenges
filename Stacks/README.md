# Stacks Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Stacks Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering stacksâ€”a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks are crucial for solving problems related to recursion, parsing, and backtracking.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Develop a deep understanding of stack operations and concepts
- Implement custom stack structures from scratch
- Solve classic stack-based coding problems
- Learn efficient techniques for real-world stack applications
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving stacks

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of stack-related topics, including:

- Stack fundamentals: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty
- Implementing stacks using arrays and linked lists
- Balanced parentheses and expression validation
- Evaluating postfix (Reverse Polish) and prefix expressions
- Infix to postfix conversion
- Design problems (e.g., Min Stack, Max Stack)
- Backtracking problems using stacks (e.g., pathfinding, undo functionality)
- Recursion and stack memory relationship
