# Caesar Cipher Encryptor

Given a `non-empty` string of lowercase letters and a `non-negative` integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by `k` positions in the alphabet, where `k` is the key.

> Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter `z` shifted by one returns the letter `a`.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
string = "xyz"
key = 2
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
"zab"
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 1</b></summary>

Most languages have `built-in functions` that give you the `Unicode` value of a character as well as the character corresponding to a `Unicode` value. Consider using such functions to determine which letters the input string's letters should be mapped to.

<summary><b>Hint 2</b></summary>

Try creating your own mapping of letters to codes. In other words, try associating each letter in the alphabet with a specific number - its position in the alphabet, for instance - and using that to determine which letters the input string's letters should be mapped to.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 3</b></summary>

How do you handle cases where a letter gets shifted to a position that requires wrapping around the alphabet? What about cases where the key is very large and causes multiple wrappings around the alphabet? The `modulo operator` should be your friend here.

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`O(n)` time | `O(n)` space - where `n` is the length of the input string.
