# Dynamic Programming Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming Code Challenges** unit! This unit is designed to help you master dynamic programming (DP)â€”a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their results.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Understand the principles of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems  
- Learn to identify problems suitable for dynamic programming  
- Solve classic DP challenges using both memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up)  
- Improve problem-solving efficiency and prepare for technical interviews involving DP
