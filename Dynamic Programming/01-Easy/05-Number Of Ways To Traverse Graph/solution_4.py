# Problem Description:

"""
                                               Number Of Ways To Traverse Graph

You're given two positive integers representing the `width` and `height` of a grid-shaped, rectangular graph. Write a function that
returns the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the graph when starting at the top left corner. Each move you take
must either go down or right. In other words, you can never move up or left in the graph.

For example, given the graph illustrated below, with `width = 2` and `height = 3`, there are three ways to reach the bottom right
corner when starting at the top left corner:

```
 _ _
|_|_|
|_|_|
|_|_|

```

1. Down, Down, Right
2. Right, Down, Down
3. Down, Right, Down

> Note: you may assume that `width * height >= 2`. In other words, the graph will never be a `1x1 grid`.


## Sample Input:
```
width = 4
height = 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
10
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n + m) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the width of the graph and `m` is the height.
```

# Solution:


# O(w * h) time | O(h) space
# Space-Optimized DP (Using 1D Array)
def number_of_ways_to_traverse_graph(width, height):
    dp = [1] * (height + 1)

    for w in range(2, width + 1):
        for h in range(2, height + 1):
            dp[h] += dp[h - 1]

    return dp[height]


# Test Cases:

print(number_of_ways_to_traverse_graph(4, 3))
# Output: 10

print(number_of_ways_to_traverse_graph(3, 2))
# Output: 3

print(number_of_ways_to_traverse_graph(2, 2))
# Output: 2
