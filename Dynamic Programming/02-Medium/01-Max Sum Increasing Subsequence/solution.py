# Problem Description:

"""
                                               Max Sum Increasing Subsequence

Write a function that takes in a `non-empty` array of integers and returns the greatest sum that can be generated from a
strictly-increasing subsequence in the array as well as an array of the numbers in that subsequence.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they
appear in the array. For instance, the numbers `[1, 3, 4]` form a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and so do the numbers
`[2, 4]`.

> Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

You can assume that there will only be one increasing subsequence with the greatest sum.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [10, 70, 20, 30, 50, 11, 30]
```

## Sample Output:
```
[110, [10, 20, 30, 50]]

// The subsequence [10, 20, 30, 50] is strictly increasing and yields the greatest sum: 110.
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n¬≤) time | O(n) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

### **Time Complexity:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `sequences = [None for x in array]` ‚Üí O(n)
   - `sums = [num for num in array]` ‚Üí O(n)

2. **Main Logic (Nested Loop):**
   - The outer loop runs `n` times (`for i in range(len(array))`).
   - The inner loop runs up to `i` times (`for j in range(0, i)`).
   - In the worst case, this results in: O(n¬≤)
   - The operations inside the inner loop (`if` condition, updates) are O(1).

3. **Building the Sequence:**
   - `build_sequence` runs in O(n) time in the worst case (if the entire array is the increasing subsequence).

**Total Time Complexity:** O(n) + O(n¬≤) + O(n) = O(n¬≤)

---

### **Space Complexity:**

1. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `sequences` ‚Üí O(n)
   - `sums` ‚Üí O(n)

2. **Output Sequence:**
   - The `build_sequence` function constructs a subsequence, which in the worst case could be O(n) (entire array).

**Total Space Complexity:** O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

---

### **Summary:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

This is optimal for the problem using dynamic programming. There is no known O(n log n) time solution for the **maximum sum**
increasing subsequence (unlike the standard **longest increasing subsequence** problem, which can be solved in O(n log n).

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
This code finds the **maximum sum increasing subsequence** in a given array of integers. An *increasing subsequence* is a subset
of elements in which each number is greater than the previous one, and elements must appear in the same order as the original
array (though not necessarily consecutively). The goal is to find the increasing subsequence with the **largest sum**.

---

### üîç High-Level Idea

For each element in the array, the algorithm checks all previous elements to see if extending the subsequence ending at that element
would produce a better sum. It keeps track of:

1. **`sums[i]`** ‚Äì the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
2. **`sequences[i]`** ‚Äì the index of the previous element in the increasing subsequence ending at `i`, used to reconstruct the sequence later.

---

### üìò Function: `max_sum_increasing_subsequence(array)`

#### Initialization:

```
sequences = [None for x in array]
sums = [num for num in array]
```

* `sums[i]`: Initially set to the value of `array[i]` because the smallest increasing subsequence ending at any index is the
element itself.
* `sequences[i]`: Initialized to `None`, indicating there's no previous element yet in the subsequence.

```
max_sum_idx = 0
```

* Stores the index of the maximum sum found so far.

---

### üîÅ Main Loop:

```
for i in range(len(array)):
    current_num = array[i]

    for j in range(0, i):
        other_num = array[j]

        if other_num < current_num and sums[j] + current_num >= sums[i]:
            sums[i] = sums[j] + current_num
            sequences[i] = j
```

* Outer loop (`i`): Iterates through each element of the array.
* Inner loop (`j`): For each `i`, it checks all previous elements `j < i`.
* If `array[j] < array[i]`, then `array[i]` can extend the increasing subsequence ending at `j`.

If extending `sums[j]` with `current_num` improves the total sum at `i`, we:

* Update `sums[i]`.
* Set `sequences[i] = j` to record the path of the subsequence.

```
if sums[i] >= sums[max_sum_idx]:
    max_sum_idx = i
```

* Update the index of the maximum sum if the current `sums[i]` is larger.

---

### üìò Function: `build_sequence(array, sequences, current_idx)`

Used to reconstruct the actual increasing subsequence.

```
sequence = []
while current_idx is not None:
    sequence.append(array[current_idx])
    current_idx = sequences[current_idx]
return list(reversed(sequence))
```

* It walks backward using the `sequences` list, appending elements to `sequence`, and then reverses it for the correct order.

---

### ‚úÖ Output:

```
return [sums[max_sum_idx], build_sequence(array, sequences, max_sum_idx)]
```

Returns a list with:

1. The **maximum sum** of any increasing subsequence.
2. The **actual subsequence** that gives this sum.

---

### üß™ Example: `[10, 70, 20, 30, 50, 11, 30]`

1. Possible increasing subsequences:

   * `[10, 20, 30, 50]` ‚Üí sum = 110
   * `[10, 70]` ‚Üí sum = 80
   * `[10, 20, 30, 50, 30]` ‚Äì invalid (not increasing at the end)

2. The code returns:

   ```
   [110, [10, 20, 30, 50]]
   ```

---

### üìà Time and Space Complexity:

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n¬≤)`

  * For each element, it may compare to all previous elements.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

  * For storing `sums` and `sequences`.

Let‚Äôs visualize how the algorithm works step-by-step using **ASCII diagrams** on this input:

```
array = [10, 70, 20, 30, 50, 11, 30]
```

---

### Step 0: Initialization

We start with:

```
Index:     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Array:    10  70  20  30  50  11  30
Sums:     10  70  20  30  50  11  30   <-- Each sum starts as the number itself
Seq:    [None]*7                      <-- No sequences yet
```

---

### Step-by-Step Update

We go from left to right and compare current element with all previous ones.

```

---

#### i = 6 (30)

* j = 2 (20) ‚Üí 30 + 30 = **60**

Seq:   [ -   0   0   2   3   0   2 ]
```

---

### Final Result

```
Max Sum = 110 at index 4
Backtrack: 4 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 0
```

```
Path:   [10, 20, 30, 50]
```
