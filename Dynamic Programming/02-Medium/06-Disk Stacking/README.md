# Disk Stacking

You're given a `non-empty` array of arrays where each subarray holds three integers and represents a disk. These integers denote each disk's width, depth, and height, respectively. Your goal is to stack up the disks and to maximize the total height of the stack. A disk must have a strictly smaller width, depth, and height than any other disk below it.

Write a function that returns an array of the disks in the final stack, starting with the top disk and ending with the bottom disk. > Note that you can't rotate disks; in other words, the integers in each subarray must represent `[width, depth, height]` at all times.

You can assume that there will only be one stack with the greatest total height.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
disks = [[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [2, 2, 8], [2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 1], [4, 4, 5]]
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
[[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [4, 4, 5]]

// 10 (2 + 3 + 5) is the tallest height we can get by stacking disks following the rules laid out above.
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 1</b></summary>

Try building an array of the same length as the array of disks. At each index `i` in this new array, store the height of the tallest tower that can be created with the disk located at index `i` at the bottom.

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 2</b></summary>

Consider sorting the disks by width, depth, or height for a slight optimization.

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 3</b></summary>

Can you efficiently keep track of potential towers in another array? Instead of storing entire sequences of disks, try storing the indices of previous disks. For example, at index `3` in this other array, store the index of the before-last disk in the tallest tower whose base is the disk at index `3`.

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`O(nÂ²)` time | `O(n)` space - where `n` is the number of disks.
