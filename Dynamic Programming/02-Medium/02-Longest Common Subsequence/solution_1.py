# Problem Description:

"""
                                              Longest Common Subsequence

Write a function that takes in two strings and returns their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a set of characters that aren't necessarily adjacent in the string but that are in the same order as
they appear in the string. For instance, the characters `["a", "c", "d"]` form a subsequence of the string `"abcd"`, and so do the
characters `["b", "d"]`.

> Note that a single character in a string and the string itself are both valid subsequences of the string.

You can assume that there will only be one longest common subsequence.


## Sample Input:
```
str_1 = "ZXVVYZW"
str_2 = "XKYKZPW"
```

## Sample Output:
```
["X", "Y", "Z", "W"]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n * m) time | O(n * m) space - where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two input strings.
```

# Solution:


# O(nm*min(n, m)) time | O(nm*min(n, m)) space
def longest_common_subsequence(str_1, str_2):
    lcs = [[[] for x in range(len(str_1) + 1)] for y in range(len(str_2) + 1)]

    for i in range(1, len(str_2) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(str_1) + 1):
            if str_2[i - 1] == str_1[j - 1]:
                lcs[i][j] = lcs[i - 1][j - 1] + [str_2[i - 1]]
            else:
                lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i - 1][j], lcs[i][j - 1], key=len)

    return lcs[-1][-1]


# Test Cases:

print(longest_common_subsequence("ZXVVYZW", "XKYKZPW"))
# Output: ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'W']

print(longest_common_subsequence("", "ABCDEFG"))
# Output: []

print(longest_common_subsequence("ABCDEFG", "APPLES"))
# Output: ['A', 'E']
