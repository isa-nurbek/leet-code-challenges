# Problem Description:

"""
                                                Reconstruct BST

The pre-order traversal of a Binary Tree is a traversal technique that starts at the tree's root node and visits nodes in the
following order:

1. Current node
2. Left subtree
3. Right subtree

Given a `non-empty` array of integers representing the `pre-order traversal` of a `Binary Search Tree (BST)`, write a function that
creates the relevant BST and returns its root node.

The input array will contain the values of BST nodes in the order in which these nodes would be visited with a pre-order traversal.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if
and only if it satisfies the `BST` property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its `value`
is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None`.


## Sample Input:
```
pre_order_traversal_values = [10, 4, 2, 1, 5, 17, 19, 18]
```

## Sample Output:
```
        10 
      /    \
     4      17
   /   \      \
  2     5     19
 /           /
1           18 
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n) time | O(n) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```
