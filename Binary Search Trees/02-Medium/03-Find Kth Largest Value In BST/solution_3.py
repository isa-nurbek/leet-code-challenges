# Problem Description:

"""
                                                Find Kth Largest Value In BST

Write a function that takes in a `Binary Search Tree (BST)` and a positive integer `k` and returns the `k`th largest integer
contained in the BST.

You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that `k` is less than or equal to the number of nodes in
the tree.

Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as distinct values. In other words, the second largest
value in a BST containing values `{5, 7, 7}` will be `7`â€”not `5`.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if
and only if it satisfies the `BST` property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its `value`
is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None`.


## Sample Input:
```
tree =   15
       /     \
      5      20
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 17   22
 /   \         
1     3   

k = 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
17
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(h + k) time | O(h) space - where `h` is the height of the tree and `k` is the input parameter.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

This code implements an algorithm to find the k-th largest value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using **Morris Traversal**,
which allows in-order traversal without recursion or a stack by temporarily modifying the tree structure.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Morris Traversal** visits each node **at most twice** (once to establish the temporary links and once to traverse after
the links are removed).
- **Total Operations**: For a BST with `n` nodes, each node is visited a constant number of times, leading to **O(n)** time complexity.

### **Space Complexity Analysis**

- Morris Traversal uses **O(1) extra space** (no recursion or stack is used; only a few pointers are maintained).
- Thus, the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### **Summary**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (worst case, where we traverse all nodes).
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant extra space).

### **Optimization Consideration**

If the BST is balanced, a more efficient approach (O(h + k), where `h` is the tree height) could be achieved using reverse
in-order traversal with a stack, but Morris Traversal ensures O(1) space at the cost of slightly higher constant factors in time.
