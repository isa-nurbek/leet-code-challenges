# Problem Description:

"""
                                                Find Kth Largest Value In BST

Write a function that takes in a `Binary Search Tree (BST)` and a positive integer `k` and returns the `k`th largest integer
contained in the BST.

You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that `k` is less than or equal to the number of nodes in
the tree.

Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as distinct values. In other words, the second largest
value in a BST containing values `{5, 7, 7}` will be `7`â€”not `5`.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if
and only if it satisfies the `BST` property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its `value`
is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None`.


## Sample Input:
```
tree =   15
       /     \
      5      20
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 17   22
 /   \         
1     3   

k = 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
17
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(h + k) time | O(h) space - where `h` is the height of the tree and `k` is the input parameter.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given code for finding the k-th largest value in a BST.

### **Time Complexity:**

1. **In-order Traversal (`in_order_traverse`):**
   - The in-order traversal visits every node exactly once, performing an `O(1)` operation (appending the value to the list)
   for each node.
   - **Time: `O(N)`**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the BST.

2. **Accessing the k-th largest value:**
   - After traversal, accessing `sorted_node_values[len(sorted_node_values) - k]` is an `O(1)` operation since list indexing
   in Python is constant time.

**Total Time Complexity: `O(N)`**  
*(Dominant term is the traversal.)*

---

### **Space Complexity:**

1. **Recursion Stack:**
   - In the worst case (a completely skewed BST), the recursion depth is `O(N)`.
   - In a balanced BST, the recursion depth is `O(log N)`.

2. **Storage for `sorted_node_values`:**
   - The list stores all `N` node values, so it takes `O(N)` space.

**Total Space Complexity: `O(N)`**  
*(The `sorted_node_values` list dominates the space usage.)*

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** 
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** 

---

### **Optimization Insight:**

The current approach is not optimal for very large BSTs because it stores all node values. A better approach would be to perform
a **reverse in-order traversal (right-root-left)** and stop early once the k-th largest element is found. This reduces the space
complexity to `O(k)` (or `O(1)` if done iteratively with early termination) and avoids unnecessary traversals.
