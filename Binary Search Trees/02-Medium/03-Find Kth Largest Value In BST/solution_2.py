# Problem Description:

"""
                                                Find Kth Largest Value In BST

Write a function that takes in a `Binary Search Tree (BST)` and a positive integer `k` and returns the `k`th largest integer
contained in the BST.

You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that `k` is less than or equal to the number of nodes in
the tree.

Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as distinct values. In other words, the second largest
value in a BST containing values `{5, 7, 7}` will be `7`â€”not `5`.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if
and only if it satisfies the `BST` property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its `value`
is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None`.


## Sample Input:
```
tree =   15
       /     \
      5      20
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 17   22
 /   \         
1     3   

k = 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
17
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(h + k) time | O(h) space - where `h` is the height of the tree and `k` is the input parameter.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given `find_kth_largest_value_in_bst` function.

### **Time Complexity: O(h + k)**

- **h**: Height of the BST.
- **k**: The k-th largest element to find.

#### **Explanation:**
1. The algorithm performs an **in-order traversal in reverse** (right-root-left) to visit nodes in descending order.
2. In the worst case, we may traverse **all the way down to the rightmost leaf** (O(h)) before starting to pop nodes from the stack.
3. Then, we pop **k** nodes to reach the k-th largest element.
4. Hence, the total time is **O(h + k)**.

### **Space Complexity: O(h)**

- **h**: Height of the BST (due to the stack).

#### **Explanation:**

1. The stack stores nodes along the **rightmost path** of the BST.
2. In the worst case (a skewed BST), the stack can hold **all nodes** (O(n)), but in a balanced BST, it's **O(log n)**.
3. Hence, the space complexity is **O(h)**.

### **Summary:**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(h + k)**  

  - Worst case (skewed tree): **O(n + k)**  
  - Best case (balanced tree): **O(log n + k)**  
  
- **Space Complexity:** **O(h)**  

  - Worst case (skewed tree): **O(n)**  
  - Best case (balanced tree): **O(log n)**  

This approach efficiently finds the k-th largest element by leveraging **reverse in-order traversal** with a stack.
