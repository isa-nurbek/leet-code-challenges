# Problem Description:

"""
                                                Same BSTs

An array of integers is said to represent the `Binary Search Tree (BST)` obtained by inserting each integer in the array, from left
to right, into the `BST`.

Write a function that takes in two arrays of integers and determines whether these arrays represent the same `BST`.

Note that you're not allowed to construct any `BST`s in your code.

A `BST` is a `Binary Tree` that consists only of `BST` nodes. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies
the `BST` property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the
values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None`.


## Sample Input:
```
array_one = [10, 15, 8, 12, 94, 81, 5, 2, 11]
array_two = [10, 8, 5, 15, 2, 12, 11, 94, 81]
```

## Sample Output:
```
True 
// Both arrays represent the BST below

          10
       /     \
      8      15
    /       /   \
   5      12    94
 /       /     /
2       11    81
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(nÂ²) time | O(d) space - where `n` is the number of nodes in each array, respectively, and `d` is the depth
of the BST that they represent.
```
