# Problem Description:

"""

                                            Number Of Binary Tree Topologies

Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of possible Binary Tree topologies that can be
created with exactly `n` nodes.

A Binary Tree topology is defined as any Binary Tree configuration, irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist only
two Binary Tree topologies when `n` is equal to `2`: a root node with a left node, and a root node with a right node.

> Note that when `n` is equal to `0`, there's one topology that can be created: the `None` node.


## Sample Input
```
n = 3
```

## Sample Output
```
5
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(nÂ²) time | O(n) space - where `n` is the input number.
```

    A binary tree topology is defined by the arrangement of nodes, without considering
