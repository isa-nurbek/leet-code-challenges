# Number Of Binary Tree Topologies

Write a function that takes in a `non-negative` integer `n` and returns the number of possible `Binary Tree topologies` that can be created with exactly `n` nodes.

A Binary Tree topology is defined as any Binary Tree configuration, irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist only two Binary Tree topologies when `n` is equal to `2`: a root node with a left node, and a root node with a right node.

> Note that when `n` is equal to `0`, there's one topology that can be created: the `None` node.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
n = 3
```

## Sample Output

## Hints

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 1</b></summary>

Every Binary Tree topology of `n` nodes where `n` is greater than `0` must have a root node and an amount of nodes on both of its sides totaling `n - 1`. For instance, one such topology could have a root node, `n - 3` nodes in its left subtree, and `2` nodes in its right subtree. Another one could have a root node, `4` nodes in its left subtree, and `n - 3` nodes in its right subtree. How many distinct Binary Tree topologies with a root node, a left subtree of `x` nodes, and a right subtree of `n - 1 - x` nodes are there?

<summary><b>Hint 2</b></summary>

Consider a Binary Tree topology of `n` nodes with a root node, `x` nodes in its left subtree, and `n - 1 - x` nodes in its right subtree, and call this topology `T1`. This is one of possibly many topologies of `n` nodes. Realize that for every distinct topology `T-Lk` of `x` nodes (i.e. for every distinct topology of `T1`'s left subtree) there is a corresponding, distinct topology of as many nodes as `T1`. Similarly, for every distinct topology `T-Rk` of `n - 1 - x` nodes (i.e. for every distinct topology of `T1`'s right subtree) there is a corresponding, distinct topology of as many nodes as `T1`. In fact, every unique combination of left and right topologies `T-Lk` and `T-Rk` forms a distinct topology of as many nodes as `T1`, and this is true for every `x` between `0` and `n - 1`. Realizing this, can you implement a recursive algorithm that solves this problem?

<summary><b>Hint 3</b></summary>

Iterate through every number `x` between `0` and `n - 1` inclusive; at every number `x`, recursively calculate the number of distinct topologies of `x` nodes and multiply that by the number of distinct topologies of `n - 1 - x` nodes. Sum all of the products that you calculate to find the total number of distinct topologies of `n` nodes.

<summary><b>Hint 4</b></summary>

Can you improve the recursive algorithm mentioned in `Hints #2` and `#3` by using a caching system (`memoization`)? Can you implement the algorithm iteratively? Is there any advantage to doing so?

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`O(n²)` time | `O(n)` space - where `n` is the input number.
