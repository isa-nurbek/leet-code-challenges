# Problem Description:

                                            Nth Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the
nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns
the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose
of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `F0`; therefore, `get_nth_fib(1)` is equal to `F0`, `get_nth_fib(2)` is
equal to `F1`, etc..


## Sample Input #1
```
n = 2
```

## Sample Output #1
```
1 

// Sequence: 0, 1
```

## Sample Input #2
```
n = 6
```

## Sample Output #2
```
5 

// Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the input number.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **Base Cases Handling**: The function handles base cases (n=1 and n=2) in constant time, O(1).
- **Memoization Check**: For each call to `get_nth_fib(n)`, the function checks if `n` is in `memoize`.
This is an O(1) operation (assuming dictionary lookups are average-case O(1)).
- **Recursive Calls**: For any `n` not in `memoize`, the function makes two recursive calls: `get_nth_fib(n-1)` and
`get_nth_fib(n-2)`. However, due to memoization, each unique `n` is computed only once. After the first computation,
the result is stored and reused.
- **Total Unique Computations**: The function computes values for `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`, which is `O(n)` unique computations.

- **Overall Time Complexity**: Since each computation is O(1) (due to memoization), the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity:

- **Memoization Dictionary**: The `memoize` dictionary stores `O(n)` entries (from `1` to `n`).
- **Recursion Stack**: In the worst case (without tail recursion optimization), the recursion stack can go up to `O(n)`
depth (e.g., for `get_nth_fib(n)`, it calls `get_nth_fib(n-1)`, which calls `get_nth_fib(n-2)`, etc., until it hits the base case).
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The dominant factor is the recursion stack and the memoization dictionary, both of which are `O(n)`.
Thus, the total space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Key Points:
- The memoization ensures that each Fibonacci number is computed only once, leading to linear time complexity.
- The space complexity is linear due to the memoization dictionary and the recursion stack.

### Summary:
Time Complexity: **O(n)**  
Space Complexity: **O(n)**

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
Let's break this code down step by step and explain how it works.

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
The function `get_nth_fib(n)` returns the **n-th Fibonacci number** using **recursion with memoization** (to make it efficient).

---

### üìå What is the Fibonacci sequence?
The Fibonacci sequence is:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```
It starts with:
- `Fib(1) = 0`
- `Fib(2) = 1`
- From then on, each number is the sum of the previous two:
  - `Fib(3) = 1` (0+1)
  - `Fib(4) = 2` (1+1)
  - `Fib(5) = 3` (1+2)
  - `Fib(6) = 5` (2+3)
  - and so on...

---

### üß† Function Definition:
```
def get_nth_fib(n, memoize=None):
```
- Takes two parameters:
  - `n`: the position in the Fibonacci sequence.
  - `memoize`: a dictionary used to remember previously computed values.

---

### üì¶ Memoization Setup:
```
if memoize is None:
    memoize = {1: 0, 2: 1}
```
- If no `memoize` dictionary is passed, we initialize it with:
  - `Fib(1) = 0`
  - `Fib(2) = 1`
- This prevents re-computing the base cases over and over.

---

### üîÅ Recursive Computation:
```
if n not in memoize:
    memoize[n] = get_nth_fib(n - 1, memoize) + get_nth_fib(n - 2, memoize)
```
- If `n` isn't already calculated:
  - Recursively calculate `Fib(n-1)` and `Fib(n-2)`
  - Add them together and store in `memoize[n]`

---

### üîô Return the result:
```
return memoize[n]
```
- Return the memoized value of `Fib(n)`

---

### üß™ Test Cases:

```
print(get_nth_fib(2))  # Output: 1
```
- Already in the memo: returns `1`

```
print(get_nth_fib(6))  # Output: 5
```
- Calculates:
  - Fib(6) = Fib(5) + Fib(4)
  - Fib(5) = Fib(4) + Fib(3)
  - ...
  - Memoization avoids recalculating the same sub-problems.

```
print(get_nth_fib(8))  # Output: 13
```
- Uses previously stored values to quickly find the result.

---

### ‚ö° Efficiency:

Without memoization (just plain recursion), the function would re-calculate the same values many times, leading
to **exponential time** O(2‚Åø).

With memoization, each value is calculated only **once**, so time complexity is **O(n)**.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

- This is a **top-down recursive Fibonacci with memoization**.
- Very efficient and readable.
- Great for medium `n`, though for very large values, **iterative** solutions are often better for avoiding deep recursion limits.
