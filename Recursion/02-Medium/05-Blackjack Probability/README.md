# Blackjack Probability

In the game of Blackjack, the dealer must draw cards until the sum of the values of their cards is greater than or equal to a `target` value minus `4`. For example, traditional Blackjack uses a `target` value of `21`, so the dealer must draw cards until their total is greater than or equal to `17`, at which point they stop drawing cards (they `"stand"`). If the dealer draws a card that brings their total above the `target` (above `21` in traditional Blackjack), they lose (they `"bust"`).

Naturally, when a dealer is drawing cards, they can either end up standing or busting, and this is entirely up to the luck of their draw.

Write a function that takes in a `target` value as well as a dealer's `starting_hand` value and returns the probability that the dealer will bust (go over the `target` value before standing). The `target` value will always be a positive integer, and the `starting_hand` value will always be a positive integer that's smaller than or equal to the `target` value.

For simplicity, you can assume that the dealer has an infinite deck of cards and that each card has a value between `1 and 10` inclusive. The likelihood of drawing a card of any value is always the same, regardless of previous draws.

Your solution should be rounded to `3 decimal` places and to the nearest value. For example, a probability of `0.314159` would be rounded to `0.314`, while a probability of `0.1337` would be rounded to `0.134`.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
target = 21
starting_hand = 15
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
0.45

"""
Drawing a 2-6 would result in the dealer standing.
Drawing a 7-10 would result in the dealer busting.
Drawing a 1 would result in a 16, meaning the dealer keeps drawing.
Drawing with a 16 results in a 0.5 probability of busting (6-10 all result in busts).
The overall probability of busting is 0.4 + (0.1 * 0.5)
The probability of busting on the first draw + the probability of busting on the second.

## Hints

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 1</b></summary>

Try first thinking about a simple case. Given a `target` value of 21 and a `starting_hand` of 15, how would you calculate the probability of busting? And how would that probability change if the `starting_hand` changes to 14?

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 2</b></summary>

The probability of busting from any given `starting_hand` is `(0.1 * p(starting_hand + 1)) + ... + (0.1 * p(starting_hand + 10))`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 3</b></summary>

Given the formula for the probability of busting, there will be a lot of repeated calculations, particularly for large `target` values with a low `starting_hand`. Can you use `memoization` to prevent recalculating these values?

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`O(t - s)` time | `O(t - s)` space - where `t` is the target, and `s` is the starting hand.
