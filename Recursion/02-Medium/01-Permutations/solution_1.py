## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

The algorithm generates all permutations of an input array. For an array of size `n`, there are `n!` (n factorial) permutations.

1. **Base Case**: When the array is empty, it adds the current permutation to the result list (`permutations`). This operation
is `O(1)` per permutation, but since there are `n!` permutations, this contributes `O(n!)` in total.
2. **Recursive Case**: For each element in the array, the algorithm:
   - Creates a new array without the current element (`array[:i] + array[i + 1:]`), which takes `O(n)` time (since slicing and
   concatenating lists is linear).
   - Creates a new permutation by appending the current element (`current_permutation + [array[i]]`), which also takes `O(n)` time
   (since appending to a list is amortized `O(1)`, but creating a new list is `O(n)`).
   - Makes a recursive call with the new array and new permutation.

At each level of recursion, the work done is proportional to the size of the current array. The recursion tree has `n` levels
(since the array shrinks by 1 element at each level), and at the `k-th` level, there are `n! / (n - k)!` nodes (each representing
a partial permutation). The total work is the sum over all levels of the work done at each level, which is `O(n * n!)`.

Thus, the **time complexity is `O(n * n!)`**.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is determined by:
1. **Output Space**: The `permutations` list stores all `n!` permutations, each of size `n`, so this takes `O(n * n!)` space.
2. **Recursion Stack**: The maximum depth of the recursion is `n` (since the array shrinks by 1 element at each level). At each
level, the algorithm creates new arrays and permutations, but these are not all stored simultaneously (they are created and
discarded as the recursion proceeds). The recursion stack itself uses `O(n)` space.
3. **Auxiliary Space**: The `current_permutation` and `new_array` are temporary and take `O(n)` space at each level, but they
are not all stored simultaneously. The total auxiliary space is `O(n)` (dominated by the recursion stack).

Thus, the **space complexity is `O(n * n!)`** (dominated by the output storage).

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * n!)` (since we generate `n!` permutations, and each permutation takes `O(n)` time to construct).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * n!)` (to store all permutations, each of size `n`). The recursion stack and auxiliary space
are `O(n)`, which is dominated by the output.

This is optimal for generating all permutations, as the output itself is of size `n * n!`.

"""
Let's walk through your `get_permutations` function step by step and break it down in detail.

### **Goal:**
Generate all **permutations** of a given list of elements.

A **permutation** is a rearrangement of the elements in a list. For example, the permutations of `[1, 2, 3]` are:

```
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 3]
[2, 3, 1]
[3, 1, 2]
[3, 2, 1]
```

---

### **Function Structure:**

```
def get_permutations(array):
    permutations = []
    permutations_helper(array, [], permutations)
    return permutations
```

- `array`: The input list whose permutations we want to generate.
- `permutations`: A list that will store all the final permutations.
- `permutations_helper`: A recursive helper function that does the actual work.

---

### **Helper Function:**

```
def permutations_helper(array, current_permutation, permutations):
    if not len(array):
        permutations.append(current_permutation)
    else:
        for i in range(len(array)):
            new_array = array[:i] + array[i + 1 :]
            new_permutation = current_permutation + [array[i]]
            permutations_helper(new_array, new_permutation, permutations)
```

Let‚Äôs break this down.

---

### üîÅ **Recursive Idea:**

1. **Base Case:**
```
if not len(array):
    permutations.append(current_permutation)
```
- This means: "If there are no more elements left in the input `array` *and* `current_permutation` is not empty, we‚Äôve built
a complete permutation."
- We then add `current_permutation` to the final `permutations` list.

---

2. **Recursive Case:**
```
for i in range(len(array)):
    new_array = array[:i] + array[i + 1 :]
    new_permutation = current_permutation + [array[i]]
    permutations_helper(new_array, new_permutation, permutations)
```

- Loop through each element in the array:
    - Choose one element (`array[i]`)
    - Remove it from the array: `new_array = array[:i] + array[i+1:]`
        - For example, if `array = [1,2,3]` and `i = 0`, then `new_array = [2,3]`
    - Add it to the current permutation: `new_permutation = current_permutation + [array[i]]`
    - Recurse with the smaller array and the updated permutation.

---

### üß† Example Walkthrough: `get_permutations([1, 2])`

Let‚Äôs see what happens step-by-step:

1. First call:  
   `array = [1, 2]`, `current_permutation = []`

2. Loop starts:
   - **i = 0**:
     - Take `1`
     - `new_array = [2]`, `new_permutation = [1]`
     - Recurse

3. Inside recursion:
   - `array = [2]`, `current_permutation = [1]`
   - **i = 0**:
     - Take `2`
     - `new_array = []`, `new_permutation = [1, 2]`
     - Recurse

4. Inside recursion:
   - `array = []`, `current_permutation = [1, 2]`
   - Base case met ‚Üí add `[1, 2]` to permutations

5. Backtrack, now **i = 1** in step 2:
   - Take `2`
   - `new_array = [1]`, `new_permutation = [2]`
   - Recurse ‚Üí leads to `[2, 1]`

---

### ‚úÖ Output:

```
print(get_permutations([1, 2, 3]))
# [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
```

Each time, it picks an element, removes it from the list, builds up a permutation, and continues recursively until the permutation is complete.

---

Let's visualize how the recursive function works step-by-step for a small input, like `[1, 2, 3]`.

We'll show the **call stack** as a tree, where each level is a recursive call and we track how permutations are built.  

---

### Initial Call:
```
get_permutations([1, 2, 3])
```
This calls:
```
permutations_helper([1, 2, 3], [], [])
```

Let‚Äôs visualize this as a tree:

---

### üìà Recursive Tree for `[1, 2, 3]`:

Each node shows:  
`array`, `current_permutation`

```
                          [1,2,3], []
                         /     |     \
                      /        |        \
          [2,3],[1]  [1,3],[2]  [1,2],[3]
           /    \       /   \       /   \
        [3],[1,2] [2],[1,3] [3],[2,1] [1],[2,3] [2],[3,1] [1],[3,2]
          |         |         |         |         |         |
         [],[1,2,3] [],[1,3,2] [],[2,1,3] [],[2,3,1] [],[3,1,2] [],[3,2,1]
```

---

### üß† How It Works:

#### Level 0 (start):
- Start with `[1,2,3]`, `[]`

#### Level 1 (choose first element):
- Pick `1`: Remaining `[2,3]`, New permutation `[1]`
- Pick `2`: Remaining `[1,3]`, New permutation `[2]`
- Pick `3`: Remaining `[1,2]`, New permutation `[3]`

#### Level 2 (choose second element):
- If you picked `1` ‚Üí `[2,3]`, `[1]`:
  - Pick `2`: ‚Üí `[3]`, `[1,2]`
  - Pick `3`: ‚Üí `[2]`, `[1,3]`

...and so on, until the array is empty and the current permutation is full.

---

### ‚úÖ When base case is hit:

When `array == []`, for example:
```
permutations_helper([], [1, 2, 3], permutations)
```

Now `[1,2,3]` is a full permutation ‚Üí it gets added to the result list.

---

### Final Result:
```
[
 [1, 2, 3],
 [1, 3, 2],
 [2, 1, 3],
 [2, 3, 1],
 [3, 1, 2],
 [3, 2, 1]
]
```
