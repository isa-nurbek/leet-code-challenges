                                        Phone Number Mnemonics

If you open the keypad of your mobile phone, it'll likely look like this:

```
   ----- ----- -----
  |     |     |     |
  |  1  |  2  |  3  |
  |     | abc | def |
   ----- ----- -----
  |     |     |     |
  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
  | ghi | jkl | mno |
   ----- ----- -----
  |     |     |     |
  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
  | pqrs| tuv | wxyz|
   ----- ----- -----
        |     |
        |  0  |
        |     |
         -----

Here's the mapping for clarity:

0: ["0"]

1: ["1"]

2: ["a", "b", "c"]

3: ["d", "e", "f"]

4: ["g", "h", "i"]

5: ["j", "k", "l"]

6: ["m", "n", "o"]

7: ["p", "q", "r", "s"]

8: ["t", "u", "v"]

9: ["w", "x", "y", "z"]
```

Almost every digit is associated with some letters in the alphabet; this allows certain phone numbers to spell out actual
words. For example, the phone number `8464747328` can be written as `timisgreat`; similarly, the phone number `2686463` can
be written as antoine or as `ant6463`.

It's important to note that a phone number doesn't represent a single sequence of letters, but rather multiple combinations
of letters. For instance, the digit `2` can represent three different letters (a, b, and c).

A mnemonic is defined as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assist in remembering something. Companies oftentimes
use a mnemonic for their phone number to make it easier to remember.

Given a stringified phone number of any non-zero length, write a function that returns all mnemonics for this phone number,
in any order.

For this problem, a valid mnemonic may only contain letters and the digits `0` and `1`. In other words, if a digit is able
to be represented by a letter, then it must be. Digits `0` and `1` are the only two digits that don't have letter
representations on the keypad.

> Note that you should rely on the keypad illustrated above for digit-letter associations.


## Sample Input
```
phone_number = "1905"
```

## Sample Output
```
[
  "1w0j",
  "1w0k",
  "1w0l",
  "1x0j",
  "1x0k",
  "1x0l",
  "1y0j",
  "1y0k",
  "1y0l",
  "1z0j",
  "1z0k",
  "1z0l",
]
// The mnemonics could be ordered differently.
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(4^n * n) time | O(4^n * n) space - where `n` is the length of the phone number.
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:**

1. **Digit to Letters Mapping:**
   - The digits `0` and `1` map to `["0"]` and `["1"]` respectively (only 1 choice per digit).
   - Digits `2` to `9` map to 3 or 4 letters each (e.g., `2` maps to `["a", "b", "c"]`).

2. **Worst Case:**
   - The worst case occurs when every digit in the phone number is from `7` or `9` (which map to 4 letters each). For example,
   if the input is `"9999"`, each digit has 4 choices.
   - Let `n` be the length of the phone number. If every digit has `4` choices, the recursion tree will have `4^n` leaves
   (since each of the `n` digits has 4 possibilities).
   
   - Thus, the total number of recursive calls is `O(4^n)`.

3. **Work per Recursive Call:**
   - At each recursive call, we append a letter to `current_mnemonic` (an `O(1)` operation for array assignment).
   - When we reach the base case (`index == len(phone_number)`), we join the `current_mnemonic` array into a string
   (an `O(n)` operation).
   - Since there are `O(4^n)` base cases, the total work for joining strings is `O(n * 4^n)`.

4. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - The dominant term is `O(n * 4^n)` because of the string joining in the base case.
   

### **Space Complexity:**

1. **Recursion Stack:**
   - The maximum depth of the recursion is `n` (the length of the phone number), so the recursion stack uses `O(n)` space.

2. **Output Storage (`mnemonics`):**
   - In the worst case, there are `4^n` mnemonics, each of length `n`.
   - Thus, the space required to store all mnemonics is `O(n * 4^n)`.

3. **Auxiliary Space (`current_mnemonic`):**
   - The `current_mnemonic` array is of size `n` and is modified in-place during backtracking.

4. **Overall Space Complexity:**
   - The dominant term is `O(n * 4^n)` due to the output storage.


### **Final Answer:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * 4^n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * 4^n)`

### **Explanation with Example:**
For a phone number like `"23"` (where `2` maps to `["a", "b", "c"]` and `3` maps to `["d", "e", "f"]`):
- The recursion tree has `3 * 3 = 9` leaves (mnemonics: `["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]`).
- The time complexity is `O(n * 3^n)` for this case (but `O(n * 4^n)` in the worst case).
- The space complexity is `O(n * 3^n)` for storing the output (but `O(n * 4^n)` in the worst case).

The worst-case scenario occurs when the phone number consists entirely of `7`s or `9`s (digits with 4 letters each).
