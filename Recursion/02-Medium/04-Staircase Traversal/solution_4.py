                                          Staircase Traversal

You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can
advance up the staircase at a time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of `height = 3` and `max_steps = 2` you could climb the staircase in 3 ways. You
could take **1 step, 1 step, then 1 step**, you could also take **1 step, then 2 steps**, and you could take **2 steps,
then 1 step**.

> Note that `max_steps <= height` will always be true.
