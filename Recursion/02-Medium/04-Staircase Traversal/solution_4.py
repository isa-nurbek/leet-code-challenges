                                          Staircase Traversal

You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can
advance up the staircase at a time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of `height = 3` and `max_steps = 2` you could climb the staircase in 3 ways. You
could take **1 step, 1 step, then 1 step**, you could also take **1 step, then 2 steps**, and you could take **2 steps,
then 1 step**.

> Note that `max_steps <= height` will always be true.


## Sample Input
```
height = 4
max_steps = 2
```

## Sample Output
```
5
// You can climb the staircase in the following ways:
// 1, 1, 1, 1
// 1, 1, 2
// 1, 2, 1
// 2, 1, 1
// 2, 2
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n) time | O(n) space - where `n` is the height of the staircase.
```

# O(n) time | O(n) space
def staircase_traversal(height, max_steps):
    if height == 0 or height == 1:
        return 1
    if max_steps == 1:
        return 1

    ways_to_top = [0] * (height + 1)
    ways_to_top[0] = 1

    window_sum = 0

    for current_height in range(1, height + 1):
        start_of_window = current_height - max_steps - 1
        end_of_window = current_height - 1

        if start_of_window >= 0:
            window_sum -= ways_to_top[start_of_window]

        window_sum += ways_to_top[end_of_window]
        ways_to_top[current_height] = window_sum

    return ways_to_top[height]


# Test Cases:

print(staircase_traversal(4, 2))  #  Output: 5
print(staircase_traversal(10, 1))  #  Output: 1
print(staircase_traversal(6, 3))  #  Output: 24
