# Problem Description:

"""
                                            Rearrange Linked List

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer `k`, rearranges the list in place (i.e., doesn't
create a brand new list) around nodes with value `k`, and returns its new head.

Rearranging a Linked List around nodes with value `k` means moving all nodes with a value smaller than `k` before all nodes with
value `k` and moving all nodes with a value greater than `k` after all nodes with value `k`.

All moved nodes should maintain their original relative ordering if possible.

Note that the linked list should be rearranged even if it doesn't have any nodes with value `k`.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None` if it's
the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; in other words, the head will never be `None`.


## Sample Input:
```
head = 3 -> 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> None
k = 3

// The head node with value 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> None

// The new head node with value 0
// Note that the nodes with values 0, 2, and 1 have maintained their original relative ordering,
and so have the nodes with values 5 and 4.
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the number of nodes in the Linked List.
```

# Big O Analysis:

"""
## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given `rearrange_linked_list` function.

### Time Complexity:

1. **Initialization**: The initialization of the six pointers (`smaller_list_head`, `smaller_list_tail`, etc.) is done
in constant time, O(1).
2. **Traversing the Linked List**: The `while` loop iterates over each node in the original linked list exactly once. If there
are `n` nodes in the linked list, this loop runs in O(n) time.
   - Inside the loop, each operation (checking the value, calling `grow_linked_list`, updating `prev_node` and `node`) is done
   in constant time, O(1).
3. **Connecting the Lists**: The `connect_linked_lists` function is called twice, and each call is done in constant time, O(1),
as it just involves updating a few pointers.
   
Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the traversal of the linked list, so the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity:

1. **Additional Pointers**: The algorithm uses a constant number of additional pointers (like `smaller_list_head`,
`smaller_list_tail`, etc.), which does not depend on the input size. Thus, the space used for these is O(1).
2. **Input and Output**: The input is the linked list of size `n`, and the output is a rearranged linked list of the same size.
However, the rearrangement is done in-place by reusing the existing nodes and only modifying their `next` pointers.
No additional data structures (like arrays or hash maps) are used.

Thus, the space complexity is **O(1)** (constant extra space), as the algorithm does not use any additional space proportional
to the input size.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place rearrangement)

# =========================================================================================================================== #

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
Let's walk through the entire code and understand it **step by step**‚Äîwhat each part does and how the pieces work together
to solve the problem of **rearranging a linked list around a pivot value `k`**.

---

### üß± 1. **LinkedList Node Class**

```
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

* This defines a simple **singly linked list node**:

  * `value`: holds the integer value of the node.
  * `next`: a pointer to the next node in the list (default is `None`).

---

### üèóÔ∏è 2. **`build_linked_list` Function**

```
def build_linked_list(data):
    ...
```

* This function **constructs a linked list** from a dictionary containing:

  * `head`: the ID of the head node.
  * `nodes`: a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a node with:

    * `id`: node's unique identifier (used for linking).
    * `value`: the integer value of the node.
    * `next`: the ID of the next node (or `None`).

#### Example Input:

```
{
    "head": "3",
    "nodes": [
        {"id": "3", "next": "0", "value": 3},
        ...
    ]
}
```

#### How it works:

1. **Creates node instances** for each dictionary entry and stores them in a `nodes` dict using their `id`.
2. **Links nodes** using the `next` field by updating the `.next` pointer of each node.
3. **Returns the head node** of the built linked list using the `head` ID.

---

### üîÄ 3. **`rearrange_linked_list(head, k)`**

This is the main logic to **rearrange the linked list** so that:

* All nodes with values **less than `k`** come first.
* Then nodes **equal to `k`**.
* Then nodes **greater than `k`**.

And **the relative order in each group is preserved**.

#### Step-by-step logic:

1. **Initialize three separate lists**:

   * `smaller_list_head` and `smaller_list_tail`: for values `< k`
   * `equal_list_head` and `equal_list_tail`: for values `== k`
   * `greater_list_head` and `greater_list_tail`: for values `> k`

2. **Traverse the original list**, and place each node into one of the three lists using the `grow_linked_list()` helper.

3. **Break the original list** by setting `prev_node.next = None` to avoid unwanted links.

4. **Connect the three lists together** using `connect_linked_lists()`:

   * First connect smaller + equal
   * Then connect that result with greater

5. **Return the new head** of the rearranged list.

---

### üåø 4. **`grow_linked_list(head, tail, node)`**

```
def grow_linked_list(head, tail, node):
    new_head = head
    new_tail = node

    if new_head is None:
        new_head = node

    if tail is not None:
        tail.next = node

    return (new_head, new_tail)
```

* Adds a `node` to the end of a list.
* Returns the new head and tail after adding.

---

### üîó 5. **`connect_linked_lists(head_one, tail_one, head_two, tail_two)`**

* Concatenates two linked lists:

  * If the first list is empty, return the second.
  * Otherwise, connect `tail_one.next` to `head_two`.

---

### üñ®Ô∏è 6. **`print_linked_list(head)`**

* Utility function to **print the linked list** for visual verification.

---

### üß™ Test Case

Given the dictionary input and `k = 3`:

**Original List** (based on the IDs and values):

```
3 -> 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> None
```

**Values and groups:**

* `< 3`: 0, 2, 1
* `== 3`: 3
* `> 3`: 5, 4

**Rearranged List:**

```
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> None
```

Which is exactly what the function prints.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This code:

* **Parses a dictionary representation** of a linked list.
* **Rearranges nodes** into three parts based on a pivot value `k`.
* **Preserves the relative order** in each group.
* **Returns the new head** of the reordered list.
