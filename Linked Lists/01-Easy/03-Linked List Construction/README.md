# Linked List Construction

Write a `DoublyLinkedList` class that has a `head` and a `tail`, both of which point to either a linked list `Node` or `None`. The class should support:

- Setting the head and tail of the linked list.
- Inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as at given positions (the position of the head node is `1`).
- Removing given nodes and removing nodes with given values.
- Searching for nodes with given values.

Note that the `setHead`, `setTail`, `insertBefore`, `insertAfter`, `insertAtPosition`, and `remove` methods all take in actual `Node`s as input parametersâ€”not integers (except for `insertAtPosition`, which also takes in an integer representing the position); this means that you don't need to create any new `Node`s in these methods. The input nodes can be either stand-alone nodes or nodes that are already in the linked list. If they're nodes that are already in the linked list, the methods will effectively be moving the nodes within the linked list. You won't be told if the input nodes are already in the linked list, so your code will have to defensively handle this scenario.

Each `Node` has an integer `value` as well as a `prev` node and a `next` node, both of which can point to either another node or `None`.

## Sample Usage

```plaintext
// Assume the following linked list has already been created:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5
// Assume that we also have the following stand-alone nodes:
3, 3, 6
setHead(4): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 5 // set the existing node with value 4 as the head
setTail(6): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 6 // set the stand-alone node with value 6 as the tail
insertBefore(6, 3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6 // move the existing node with value 3 before the existing node with value 6
insertAfter(6, 3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6 <-> 3 // insert a stand-alone node with value 3 after the existing node with value 6
insertAtPosition(1, 3): 3 <-> 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6 <-> 3 // insert a stand-alone node with value 3 in position 1
removeNodesWithValue(3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 6 // remove all nodes with value 3
remove(2): 4 <-> 1 <-> 5 <-> 6 // remove the existing node with value 2
containsNodeWithValue(5): True
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary><b>Hint 1</b></summary>

When dealing with linked lists, it's very important to keep track of pointers on nodes (i.e., the `"next"` and `"prev"` properties on the nodes). For instance, if you're inserting a node in a linked list, but that node is already located somewhere else in the linked list (in other words, if you're moving a node), it's crucial to completely update the pointers of the adjacent nodes of the node being moved before updating the node's own pointers. The order in which you update nodes' pointers will make or break your algorithm.

<summary><b>Hint 2</b></summary>

Realize that the `insertBefore()` and `insertAfter()` methods can be used to implement the `setHead()`, `setTail()`, and `insertAtPosition()` methods; making the `insertBefore()` and `insertAfter()` methods as robust as possible will simplify your code for the other methods. Make sure to take care of edge cases involving inserting nodes before the head of the linked list or inserting nodes after the tail of the linked list.

<summary><b>Hint 3</b></summary>

Similar to `Hint #2`, realize that the `remove()` method can be used to implement the `removeNodesWithValue()` method as well as parts of the `insertBefore()` and `insertAfter()` methods; make sure that the `remove()` method handles edge cases regarding the head and the tail.

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`setHead`, `setTail`, `insertBefore`, `insertAfter`, and `remove`: `O(1)` time | `O(1)` space.
`insertAtPosition`: `O(p)` time | `O(1)` space - where `p` is input position.
`removeNodesWithValue`, `containsNodeWithValue`: `O(n)` time | `O(1)` space - where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
