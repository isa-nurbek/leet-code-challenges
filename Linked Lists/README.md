# Linked List Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Linked List Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering linked listsâ€”an essential data structure used to store ordered collections of data. Linked lists form the foundation of many advanced structures and algorithms.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Strengthen understanding of singly and doubly linked lists
- Build custom linked list implementations from scratch
- Solve classic linked list coding problems
- Learn efficient traversal, insertion, deletion, and reversal techniques
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving linked lists

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of linked list-related topics, including:

- Singly and doubly linked list structures
- Traversing and modifying linked lists
- Detecting and handling cycles (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection)
- Finding the middle of a linked list
- Reversing a linked list (iterative and recursive)
- Merging and sorting linked lists
- Intersection and palindrome detection
- Advanced operations (e.g., LRU Cache, flattening multilevel lists)

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
