# Dictionaries Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Dictionaries Code Challenges** unit! This unit focuses on mastering dictionariesâ€”powerful data structures in Python used to store key-value pairs. Dictionaries are essential for efficient lookups, frequency counts, and solving real-world data mapping problems.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Develop a strong grasp of dictionary operations and use-cases  
- Learn to solve classic problems using hashing and key-value mapping  
- Practice transforming data between different structures using dictionaries  
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving dictionaries  

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of dictionary-related topics, including:

- Creating and updating dictionaries
- Dictionary traversal and nested dictionaries
- Counting and grouping elements (e.g., frequency maps)
- Inverting dictionaries and merging multiple dictionaries
- Hash map-based problem solving (e.g., two-sum, anagrams)
- Set and dictionary relationships
- Efficient lookup strategies
- Using `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict` from `collections`
