## ðŸš€ Goals

- Deepen understanding of various sorting algorithms and their mechanics
- Implement classic sorting algorithms from scratch
- Analyze and compare the performance of different sorting techniques
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithm challenges involving sorting

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide variety of sorting-related topics, including:

- Comparison-based sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort)
- Divide and conquer sorting (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Non-comparison sorts (e.g., Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort)
- In-place vs. stable sorting
- Time and space complexity analysis of sorting algorithms
- Hybrid sorting methods (e.g., TimSort)
- Practical use cases and choosing the right sorting strategy
