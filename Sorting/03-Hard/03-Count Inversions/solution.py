# Problem Description:

"""
                                                Count Inversions

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the number of `inversions` in the array. An `inversion` occurs
if for any valid indices `i` and `j`, `i < j` and `array[i] > array[j]`.

For example, given `array = [3, 4, 1, 2]`, there are `4 inversions`. The following pairs of indices represent inversions:
`[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]`.

Intuitively, the number of inversions is a measure of how unsorted the array is.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [2, 3, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6]
```

## Sample Output:
```
5

// The following pairs of indices represent inversions: [0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 5], [4, 6]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n log n) time | O(n) space - where `n` is the length of the array.
```

# Big O Analysis:

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity Analysis:

The given code counts the number of inversions in an array using a modified merge sort algorithm.
Here's the breakdown of the time complexity:

1. **Divide Step**: The array is recursively divided into two halves until the base case (subarrays of size 1 or 0) is reached.
This division takes O(log n) time because the array is halved at each recursive call.

2. **Conquer Step**: The inversions are counted in the left half, the right half, and during the merge step. The work done at each
level of recursion is O(n) for the merge step (explained below), and there are O(log n) levels of recursion.

3. **Merge Step**: The `merge_sort_and_count_inversions` function merges two sorted subarrays and counts the inversions across them.
This is done in O(n) time per merge, where `n` is the total number of elements in the two subarrays being merged. The key operation
is counting inversions when an element from the right subarray is placed before elements in the left subarray, which is done in
constant time per such occurrence.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), which is the same as the standard merge sort. This is because the additional work
for counting inversions during the merge step does not increase the asymptotic complexity.

### Space Complexity Analysis:

1. **Recursive Calls**: The recursion depth is O(log n), but this does not contribute significantly to space complexity beyond the
stack space.

2. **Temporary Array**: The `merge_sort_and_count_inversions` function uses a temporary array (`sorted_array`) to store the merged
result before copying it back to the original array. The size of this temporary array is proportional to the number of elements
being merged, which is O(n) in the worst case.

Thus, the space complexity is O(n) due to the additional space used for merging. The algorithm is not purely in-place because of
this temporary storage.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (due to the temporary array used in merging)

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
## ðŸ’¡ What Is an Inversion?

An **inversion** is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

* `i < j`
* and `array[i] > array[j]`

Itâ€™s a measure of how far the array is from being sorted.
For example, in `[2, 3, 1]`, the pairs `(2,1)` and `(3,1)` are inversions â†’ total = 2.

---

## âœ… Function Overview

### 1. `count_inversions(array)`

This is the **main function**.
It just calls the helper function `count_sub_array_inversions()` with the full range of the array.

```
def count_inversions(array):
    return count_sub_array_inversions(array, 0, len(array))
```

---

### 2. `count_sub_array_inversions(array, start, end)`

This function **recursively divides** the array like merge sort.

```
if end - start <= 1:
    return 0
```

Base case: A sub-array with â‰¤ 1 element has 0 inversions.

```
middle = start + (end - start) // 2
```

Calculate the midpoint.

```
left_inversions = count_sub_array_inversions(array, start, middle)
right_inversions = count_sub_array_inversions(array, middle, end)
```

Recursively count inversions in the left and right halves.

```
merged_array_inversions = merge_sort_and_count_inversions(array, start, middle, end)
```

Count **split inversions** while merging the two sorted halves.

Finally, return the total:

```
return left_inversions + right_inversions + merged_array_inversions
```

---

### 3. `merge_sort_and_count_inversions(array, start, middle, end)`

This function:

* **Merges** two sorted subarrays `array[start:middle]` and `array[middle:end]`.
* While merging, it counts **inversions** that occur across the split (left element > right element).

```
while left < middle and right < end:
    if array[left] <= array[right]:
        sorted_array.append(array[left])
        left += 1
    else:
        inversions += middle - left
        sorted_array.append(array[right])
        right += 1
```

* If `array[left] > array[right]`, then **all elements from `left` to `middle - 1`** are greater than `array[right]`.
So, add `middle - left` to the inversion count.

Then append the remaining elements (if any) and **copy the sorted values back into the original array**:

```
sorted_array += array[left:middle] + array[right:end]

for idx, num in enumerate(sorted_array):
    array[start + idx] = num
```

Return the count of inversions found during this merge.

---

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases and Output

### Test 1

```
[2, 3, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6]
```

Inversions:

* (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6) â†’ **5**

âœ… Output: `5`

---

### Test 2

```
[5, -1, 2, -4, 3, 4, 19, 87, 762, -8, 0]
```

This has **23** inversions. The function correctly counts all of them.

âœ… Output: `23`

---

### Test 3

```
[]
```

No elements = no inversions.

âœ… Output: `0`

---

## ðŸ“Š Time Complexity

This algorithm is an enhanced merge sort:

* Divide step: `O(log n)`
* Merge and count step: `O(n)`
* Total: **O(n log n)**

Efficient even for large arrays.

---

## âœ… Summary

* Uses **divide and conquer** via merge sort.
* Counts:

  * Left-side inversions
  * Right-side inversions
  * Cross (split) inversions
* Very efficient compared to brute-force `O(nÂ²)` approach.

---

Hereâ€™s an **ASCII visualization** of how the inversion-counting process works using **merge sort** for the input array:

```
Input: [2, 3, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6]
```

---

### STEP 1: Split the array (Divide Phase)

We recursively split the array:

```
[2, 3, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6]
     |
     +--------------------------+
     |                          |
[2, 3, 3, 1]               [9, 5, 6]
     |                          |
     +--------+          +------+   
     |        |          |           
[2, 3]    [3, 1]     [9]     [5, 6]
  |          |                 |
 [2] [3]   [3] [1]           [5] [6]
```

---

### STEP 2: Count Inversions during Merge Phase

We now merge upwards and count inversions.

#### Merge [2] and [3] â†’ No inversions

```
Merge: [2] + [3] â†’ [2, 3] (inversions: 0)
```

#### Merge [3] and [1] â†’ One inversion

```
Compare 3 > 1 â†’ inversion
Merge: [3] + [1] â†’ [1, 3] (inversions: 1)
```

#### Merge [2, 3] and [1, 3]

```
Compare:
  2 > 1 â†’ inversion (count += 2 - 0 = 2)
  3 > 1 â†’ inversion
â†’ [1, 2, 3, 3]
â†’ Total new inversions = 2
Subtotal for left half: 0 (from [2,3]) + 1 (from [3,1]) + 2 = **3**
```

#### Merge [5] and [6] â†’ No inversion

```
Merge: [5] + [6] â†’ [5, 6] (inversions: 0)
```

#### Merge [9] and [5, 6]

```
9 > 5 â†’ inversion (count += 1)
9 > 6 â†’ inversion (count += 1)
â†’ [5, 6, 9]
â†’ Total new inversions = 2
Subtotal for right half: 0 (from [5,6]) + 2 = **2**
```

---

### STEP 3: Merge [1, 2, 3, 3] and [5, 6, 9]

All elements on the left are â‰¤ those on the right â†’ **no new inversions**

```
Final Merge: [1, 2, 3, 3] + [5, 6, 9]
â†’ [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9]
â†’ No new inversions
```

---

### FINAL RESULT:

Add all inversions:

```
Left half:   3 inversions
Right half:  2 inversions
Split merge: 0 inversions

TOTAL = 3 + 2 + 0 = **5 inversions**
```

---

### Tree with inversion counts:

                  Merge â†’ [2, 3]            Merge â†’ [5, 6]

                             â†‘
                         Total 3 inv

TOTAL inversions: **5**
