# Problem Description:

"""
                                               Three Number Sort

You're given an array of integers and another array of three distinct integers. The first array is guaranteed to only contain
integers that are in the second array, and the second array represents a desired order for the integers in the first array. For
example, a second array of `[x, y, z]` represents a desired order of `[x, x, ..., x, y, y, ..., y, z, z, ..., z]` in the first array.

Write a function that sorts the first array according to the desired order in the second array.

The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input array), and it shouldn't use any auxiliary space
(i.e., it should run with constant space: `O(1)` space).

> Note that the desired order won't necessarily be ascending or descending and that the first array won't necessarily contain all
three integers found in the second arrayâ€”it might only contain one or two.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1]
order = [0, 1, -1]
```

## Sample Output:
```
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
O(n) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the array.
```

# Solution:


# O(n) time | O(1) space
def three_number_sort(array, order):
    # The order array contains the desired order of values: [first_value, second_value, third_value]
    first_value = order[0]
    second_value = order[1]
    # The third_value isn't needed explicitly since it's whatever remains

    # Initialize three pointers:
    # first_idx: boundary of where first_value elements end (starts at 0)
    # second_idx: current element being examined (starts at 0)
    # third_idx: boundary of where third_value elements begin (starts at end of array)
    first_idx, second_idx, third_idx = 0, 0, len(array) - 1

    # Iterate while the current pointer hasn't passed the third_value boundary
    while second_idx <= third_idx:
        value = array[second_idx]

        if value == first_value:
            # If current value belongs in the first group, swap it with the element at first_idx
            array[second_idx], array[first_idx] = array[first_idx], array[second_idx]
            # Move both first and second pointers forward
            first_idx += 1
            second_idx += 1
        elif value == second_value:
            # If current value belongs in the middle group, just move the second pointer forward
            second_idx += 1
        else:
            # If current value belongs in the third group, swap it with the element at third_idx
            array[second_idx], array[third_idx] = array[third_idx], array[second_idx]
            # Move the third pointer backward (we don't move second_idx because the swapped
            # element needs to be examined in the next iteration)
            third_idx -= 1

    return array


# Test Cases:

print(three_number_sort([1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, -1]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]

print(three_number_sort([7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [8, 7, 9]))
# Output: [8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

print(three_number_sort([], [0, 7, 9]))
# Output: []
