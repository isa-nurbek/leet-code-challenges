# Problem Description:

"""
                                               Quick Sort

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a `sorted` version of that array. Use the `Quick Sort` algorithm
to sort the array.

To avoid `O(n¬≤)` worst-case time complexity you can:

- Choose a `random pivot` or `median-of-three pivot`.
- Use an `in-place partitioning` scheme to reduce space usage.

1. **Avoiding O(n¬≤) worst-case**: Quick Sort can degrade to `O(n¬≤)` time complexity if poorly chosen pivots (e.g., always picking
the `first/last` element in an already sorted array) lead to highly unbalanced partitions. The suggestions address this:
   - **Random pivot**: Randomization makes worst-case behavior unlikely.
   - **Median-of-three pivot**: Choosing the median of the first, middle, and last elements helps avoid bad pivots.

2. **In-place partitioning**: This reduces space complexity from O(log n) (due to recursion stack) to O(1) auxiliary space
(excluding the stack), making it more memory-efficient.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

## Sample Output:
```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
Best: O(n log(n)) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array.
Average: O(n log(n)) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array.
Worst: O(n¬≤) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array.
```

    2. Partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays:
       - Elements less than or equal to the pivot
       - Elements greater than the pivot

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity:

1. **Best Case**: O(n log n) - When the pivot always divides the array into two nearly equal parts. This leads to `log n`
recursive calls, each doing O(n) work for partitioning.

2. **Average Case**: O(n log n) - On average, with random input, the pivot will divide the array reasonably well.

3. **Worst Case**: O(n¬≤) - When the pivot is always the smallest or largest element (e.g., already sorted array with this
implementation). This leads to n recursive calls, each doing O(n) work.

**Why worst case is O(n¬≤) for this implementation**:
- The code always chooses the last element as the pivot (`pivot = arr[-1]`).
- For an already sorted array, this means each partition creates:
  - `left` with n-1 elements
  - `right` with 0 elements
- This leads to n recursive calls, each doing O(n) work for partitioning.

### Space Complexity:

1. **Worst Case**: O(n) - Due to recursion stack space in the worst case (unbalanced partitions).
   - In the worst case (sorted array), there are n recursive calls on the stack.
   - Each recursive call creates new `left` and `right` lists, but these are not simultaneously alive on the stack (space gets
   reclaimed after each call returns).

2. **Best/Average Case**: O(log n) - Space for recursion stack in balanced cases.

### Summary:

- **Time Complexity**:

    Best Case: O(n log(n)) 
    Average Case: O(n log(n)) 
    Worst Case: O(n¬≤) 

- **Space Complexity**: 

    Best Case: O(log(n)) 
    Average Case: O(log(n)) 
    Worst Case: O(n)

---

**Additional Notes**:

- This implementation is not in-place (it creates new lists in each recursive call).
- The space for the new lists is not counted in the space complexity above because it's temporary and doesn't accumulate (Python
garbage collection reclaims it).
- If we counted the auxiliary space for the new lists, it would be O(n) in all cases (but this is typically not how space complexity
is analyzed for recursive algorithms unless it's persistent space).

### Improvements:

To avoid O(n¬≤) worst-case time complexity:
1. Choose a random pivot or median-of-three pivot.
2. Use an in-place partitioning scheme to reduce space usage.

# Detailed Code Explanation:

"""
Let's walk through the Quick Sort implementation you posted step by step.

---

## üîç Function Overview

```
def quick_sort(arr):
```

This function takes a list (or array) of numbers, `arr`, and returns a sorted version of that list using the Quick Sort algorithm.

---

## üß† Base Case

```
if len(arr) <= 1:
    return arr.copy()
```

If the array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted. So the function returns a copy of the array (to avoid modifying the original).

---

## üéØ Choosing a Pivot

```
pivot = arr[-1]
```

The pivot is the last element in the array. Quick Sort uses a pivot to partition the array into two parts:

* Elements less than or equal to the pivot (go to the left)
* Elements greater than the pivot (go to the right)

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Partitioning

```
left = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x <= pivot]
right = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]
```

* `arr[:-1]` excludes the pivot itself.
* `left` holds elements less than or equal to the pivot.
* `right` holds elements greater than the pivot.

---

## üîÅ Recursion

```
return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)
```

This is the recursive step:

* Recursively sort the left part
* Add the pivot in the middle
* Recursively sort the right part

Combining these gives the final sorted array.

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```
quick_sort([8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3])
```

1. Pivot = 3
2. Left = [2]
3. Right = [8, 5, 9, 5, 6]

Then it recursively sorts [2] and [8, 5, 9, 5, 6], and so on.

---

## üß™ Test Cases Recap

```
print(quick_sort([8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]))
# [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

print(quick_sort([-4, 5, 10, 8, -10, -6, -4, -2, -5, 3, 5, -4, -5, -1, 1, 6, -7]))
# [-10, -7, -6, -5, -5, -4, -4, -4, -2, -1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 10]

print(quick_sort([2, 1]))
# [1, 2]
```

All these test cases confirm the function works correctly, including for:

* Negative numbers
* Repeated values
* Small lists

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This Quick Sort implementation:

* Is clear and readable
* Uses list comprehensions for partitioning
* Works recursively
* Does not modify the original list

It‚Äôs good for learning and small lists, but for large inputs, creating many sublists with list comprehensions may use extra memory.

Here's an ASCII visualization of how the Quick Sort algorithm works on this sample input:

```
quick_sort([8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3])
```

## üîÅ Step-by-step Quick Sort (Pivot = Last Element)

```
Initial Array:
[8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]

Step 1:
Pivot = 3
Left  = [2]
Right = [8, 5, 9, 5, 6]

Now sort left and right parts:
quick_sort([2]) + [3] + quick_sort([8, 5, 9, 5, 6])

-------------------------------------

Left side done:
[2]

Right side (quick_sort([8, 5, 9, 5, 6])):

Step 2:
Pivot = 6
Left  = [5, 5]
Right = [8, 9]

quick_sort([5, 5]) + [6] + quick_sort([8, 9])

-------------------------------------

quick_sort([5, 5]):

Pivot = 5
Left  = [5]
Right = []

=> [5] + [5] + [] = [5, 5]

quick_sort([8, 9]):

Pivot = 9
Left  = [8]
Right = []

=> [8] + [9] + [] = [8, 9]

Now combine:
[5, 5] + [6] + [8, 9] = [5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

-------------------------------------

Final combination:

Left:  [2]
Pivot: [3]
Right: [5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

=> [2] + [3] + [5, 5, 6, 8, 9] = [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Sorted Array

```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```
