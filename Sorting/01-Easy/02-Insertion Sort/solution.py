# Problem Description:

"""
                                             Insertion Sort

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a `sorted` version of that array. Use the `Insertion Sort` algorithm
to sort the array.


## Sample Input:
```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

## Sample Output:
```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity:
```
Best: O(n) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
Average: O(nÂ²) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
Worst: O(nÂ²) time | O(1) space - where `n` is the length of the input array.
```

    Insertion Sort works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time.
    It takes each element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position
